This is a project on the nonlinear calibration of triaxial force sensors' sensitivity. 
Four models have been developed, namely BPNN, WNN, REFNN, and ELM. 
The models were developed using the Python language on the PyCharm platform. 
The project includes the original dataset of input and output for triaxial force sensors in synchronous calibration.
